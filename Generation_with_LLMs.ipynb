        "LLMs, or Large Language Models, are the key component behind text generation. In a nutshell, they consist of large pretrained transformer models trained to predict the next word (or, more precisely, token) given some input text. Since they predict one token at a time, you need to do something more elaborate to generate new sentences other than just calling the model â€” you need to do autoregressive generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Autoregressive generation is the inference-time procedure of iteratively calling a model with its own generated outputs, given a few initial inputs. In ðŸ¤— Transformers, this is handled by the generate() method, which is available to all models with generative capabilities.\n",

        "A critical aspect of autoregressive generation with LLMs is how to select the next token from this probability distribution. Anything goes in this step as long as you end up with a token for the next iteration. This means it can be as simple as selecting the most likely token from the probability distribution or as complex as applying a dozen transformations before sampling from the resulting distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process depicted above is repeated iteratively until some stopping condition is reached. Ideally, the stopping condition is dictated by the model, which should learn when to output an end-of-sequence (EOS) token.
